# Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Cyber-Drill-Simulation-Tool-v0.0.1
Accurate-Cyber-Defense Cyber Drill Simulation Tool v0.0.1 is a practical and educational cybersecurity platform designed for students, network engineers, and cybersecurity beginners who want hands-on experience with real-world network and security operations.
This tool focuses on cyber drill simulations, network monitoring, and controlled command execution in a safe learning environment.

The tool supports complete Telegram integration, allowing users to configure a Telegram bot and execute network commands remotely using simple /command formats. This feature makes it ideal for remote labs, training sessions, and instructor-led cyber drills. Users can run commands such as ping, traceroute, nmap, curl, ssh, and wget directly from Telegram or the local terminal, making learning flexible and interactive.

Accurate-Cyber-Defense v0.0.1 includes real-time network monitoring and basic threat detection, helping users understand how attacks and abnormal traffic patterns appear on live systems. The tool can monitor ports, detect suspicious connection behavior, and log network activity for later review. All operations are stored in an SQLite database, providing a clear history of executed commands, scan results, and alerts.

The platform is built with a modular Python architecture, making it easy to extend and customize for future versions. It is suitable for cyber security training, classroom demonstrations, self-study, and beginner-level SOC simulations. The simple setup process allows users to install dependencies, configure Telegram, and start using the tool within minutes.

Accurate-Cyber-Defense Cyber Drill Simulation Tool v0.0.1 is strictly for educational and defensive purposes. It helps learners build strong foundational skills in networking, monitoring, and cyber defense while understanding how professional security tools operate in real environments.
